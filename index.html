        <li>Cook the chicken. Add 3 cups of water to the chicken. Bring to a boil on high heat then let it simmer on medium heat for about 18 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>Cook the tomatoes. Add fresh tomatoes to blender and blend to a paste. Do not add water while blending. Pour the blended tomatoes into a medium saucepan. Let it cook on medium heat for 20 minutes until the tomatoes shrink. Do not stir while the tomatoes cook down.

        <li>Note: I reserved two cups of stock.
        </li>
        <li>Fry chicken. Place oil in a frying pan up to 2 inches. Let the oil heat up then add the chicken to the oil and fry until golden brown. When one side turns golden, flip to the other side.
        </li>
        <li>Remove fried chicken and place on paper towel to absorb the excess oil. Let the oil cool down then take out out one cup f oil to cook the rice.
        </li>
        <li>Make the sauce for the rice. Place one cup of the oil used in frying the chicken into a non-stick or heavy bottom pot. Let the oil heat up then add the remaining onions. Sauté for two minutes while stirring from time to time until the onions are fragrant.
        </li>
        <li>Add the cooked-down tomatoes to the pot and cook while stirring for about 5 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>Add the tomato sauce and cook while stirring from time to time until the sauce shrinks and starts sticking to the bottom of the pot.
        </li>
        <li>Add in the one teaspoon of dried thyme and stir so it releases its flavor.
        </li>
        <li>Add in the remaining blended garlic and ginger. Stir well and let it cook for about 2 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>Wash rice. Wash the rice 3-4 times to remove the excess starch.
        </li>
        <li>Add rice to pot. Add the washed rice to the pot with tomato sauce. Stir well to combine.
        </li>
        <li>Add in the reserved 2 cups of chicken stock, the remaining one teaspoon of salt, two teaspoons of chicken bouillon powder, half teaspoon of white pepper and 2 bay leaves. Stir everything to combine.
        </li>
        <li>Add in two cups of water. Cover the pot tightly with a large sheet of aluminum foil (this will help trap the steam into the pot). lace the lead on the pot and reduce the heat to low.
        </li>
        <li>Cook rice on low. Let the rice cook on low heat for 20 minutes. Open the pot and gently stir the rice being careful not to break the grains.
        </li>
        <li>Cover the rice again with aluminum foil and the place the lid of the pot on the aluminum foil. (Watch the video to see what I mean.)
        </li>
        <li>Let the rice cook on low heat for another 20 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>Add carrots and green beans. Open the pot and add the diced carrots and green beans. Cover and let the veggies cook with the rice for 5 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>Fluff and serve. Remove bay leaves, fluff rice with a fork and serve with the fried chicken. You could serve with an additional salad if you so desire.
        </li>
      </ul>

<p><b>Notes</b>
    <ul>
      <li>For this recipe I used jasmine rice but any long grain rice would work as well.</li>

      <li>Instead of frying the chicken you could broil it in the oven until golden brown.</li>
    </ul>
